The Youth Vote

Our website is an online voting web application with the aim of encouraging young people to vote

How to use the site:

Anyone can browse the site and look at the vote results and access the links to access online resources which align with the core values of the project of getting young people involved in democracy

To use the voting feature of the website a school must first register to vote with us:
A teacher enters their school name and how many pollcards they would like (1 poll card represents 1 student vote)
They submit this request and then recieve the poll cards to hand out to their students

Once a student has recieved their poll card they navigate to the website, enter their poll card number and age, and then they are able to vote.

Once they have voted they will be redirected to the results and be able to see how young people accross the country have voted.
